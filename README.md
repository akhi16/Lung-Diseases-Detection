# Lung-Diseases-Detection
First source dataset: A database of CXR images including COVID-19 (3,616), normal (10,192), and viral pneumonia (1,345) and lung opacity(6,012) was built by researchers and academics from Qatar and Bangladesh, among others.
Second source dataset: Kaggle provided the 4,273 CXR image dataset where 1,493 for Pneumonia (Virus) and 2,780 for Pneumonia (Bacteria).
Third source dataset: The tuberculosis (3,500) and fibrosis (1,686) images were extracted from Kaggle.                                               
A new dataset was created by integrating the three individual datasets.The new dataset consists of 18,564 CXR images with seven classes(COVID,normal, viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia,tuberculosis,lung opacity and fibrosis).
